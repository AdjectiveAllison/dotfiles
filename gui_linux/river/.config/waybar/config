    // "wlr/taskbar" - quite useful for seeing active applicatons. TODO: revisit using once I get tofi setup and I'm no longer launching things in terminal. 
    // pulseaudio - pulseaudio/slider - wireplumber can all be used for audio. pulseaudio seems the most useful for me. TODO: setup pulseaudio config.
    // river/mode just displays normal currently, do I need that? TODO: setup formatting for river/tags
    // "keyboard-state" - could be fun to have but currently getting permissions error even though I'm in input group.
    // "privacy" - could be nice to see when applications use camera/mic/audio/etc but it says no module found currently. TODO: Update ot newer version of waybar?
    // "network" - This would be nice if I'm on wifi or need to troubleshoot or something later on but right now I don't really need it. 
    // "mpd" - Music Player Daemon / "mpris" - libplayerctl - See which of these is easier to get working with deezer.
    // "group" is really cool looking and maybe could be used if I end up setting a lock screen and reboot commands and stuff. Also potentially for default hiding the taskbar and opening up in the group if desired.
    // "gamemode" looks really nifty actually if I end up in a laptop environment or just want to optimize performance for games.
    // "cava" - Cross platform Audio visualizer - Could be fun to play with if I get bored(will never have time)
    // "bluetooth" - blueman app indicator in tray solves my needs for a bluetooth specific setting.
    // "idle_inhibitor" will only be relevant once I have something that tells my system I'm afk, which rigth now doesn't exist.
